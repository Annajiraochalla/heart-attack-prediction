# Investigating the Effect of Information Theory in Machine Learning for Predicting Myocardial Infarction

This project is a teamwork. All the team members were notified and attended all the corresponding meetings to exchange ideas, share knowledge and maintain accountability. Additionally, every team member has done their own portion of the work efficiently. Rohan Hanamsagar, Upendhar Deshaboina, and Venkateswara Rao Thota prepared the project documentation. Annajirao Challa and Omar Abueed made the project presentation. Upendhar Deshaboina and Rohan Hanamsagar did the data preprocessing for each model. Venkateswara Rao Thota calculated the mutual information values for the dataset variables and divided the original dataset into two datasets. Annajirao Challa implemented the four models for the classification and calculated their accuracies for three datasets. Omar Abueed performed cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for the four models and three datasets. All the authors read and approved the final manuscript.
